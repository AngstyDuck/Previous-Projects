# F01 Group 3 2D PW-DW Project
###### Objective: Using a sensor provided, collect the readings from the sensor x time from beginning of experiment at y temperature. Using multiple readings at different temperatures and timings, create a linear regression model to predict the actual temperature of water when the sensor is placed into water of a certain temperature.

 The code within these folders, notably *2D_code1.0.py*, mainly focused on the pre-processing of the data received from the sensor.  This involves processing the txt file that *emo_therm_sensor_ver2.py* produces into numpy arrays, and has the option of saving it as pickle files (with codes that read pickle into numpy again of course). Linear regression model used is matrix transformation of an image on a line (since a simple linear correlation is what we hypothesized), and the code for this matrix transformation is not included in this folder.
